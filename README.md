# 🎧 Spotify Clustering Project

This project is the final submission for the [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning), focusing on unsupervised learning techniques.

## 📌 Objective
The goal is to identify distinct clusters of songs based on their audio features, which can help music streaming platforms better understand user preferences and improve recommendation systems.

## 🧠 Methods Used
- Data Preprocessing (Scaling, Encoding)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Cluster Profiling

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes over **232,000 songs** with features such as tempo, energy, valence, key, genre, and more.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified **5 clear clusters** ranging from classical and instrumental to mainstream energetic tracks.
- PCA was used to visualize the song distribution in 2D.
- Cluster profiling helped uncover meaningful differences in tempo, mood, and genre.
